# Urban Isochrones
## Research Question
Creating a generalizeable standardized definition of city delinations using urban isochrones. 
- Studied US Metros using CBSA Metro definitions to help understand our isochrones
- Hope to create a global metric using Population Raster data

## Data
Used many data sources to support our work: 
- US TigerLine Shapefiles at County, Tract and Block Group level
- [HERE][https://developer.here.com/documentation/routing/topics/introduction.html] Rest API to create isochrones
    https://developer.here.com/documentation/routing/topics/introduction.html
- Google API to geocode cities to coordinate centroids
- World Pop Population Raster Data
